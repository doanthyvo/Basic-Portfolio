                        I am a aspiring web developer looking for opportunity to contribute to some amazing and interesting projects. Currently I am enrolled in a Full Flex Development Bootcamp offered by the University of Toronto's School of Continuing Education. I will be completing the program in October 2018. Previous to that, I graduated from Ryerson University's Bachelor of Architectural Science, where I was first introduced to the joys of coding by programming interactive installations. Well, you can say I was first introduced to the joys of coding from MySpace and Asian Avenue, but that is a dark past that we can into when we know each other better. Architecture school provided me the means to explore and apply coding to real life situations and I want to get back to that.
                        <br>
                        Currently in my career, I am an entry-level project management professional, specializing in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry. I help manage construction projects through documentation control, scheduling, budgeting, as well as building relationships with clients and the project team. I enjoy being in a client-facing role and being able to influence how a project is delivered.
                        <br>
                        I am still fresh in the coding world, but I am keen to constantly learn. I might not be the best coder yet, but that is something I will work towards and I hope you can help provide me the opportunities to.
